suspected to soon turn into beasts. Assassins similar to Brador, except they targeted normal folk, 
usually before they turned. The beggar look possibly means they killed victims in dark alleys and hid bodies.
The last line, finding signs of the scourge where there are none suggests that this got out of hand. 
The suspicious beggar, possible harrowed hunter eventually lost it as he became a beast and 
probably simply began killing people, regardless of whether they were infected or not."

But to an observer, the iron cage appears to be precisely what delivered them to their harrowing nightmare."</description>

^n""Mensis" is a Latin word for "month", possibly deriving from a proto-indo-european word for "moon, measure",
as referring to the moons phases as a measure of time. "Menses", or "months" is also the origin of the word 
"menstruation", which was once associated with the phases of the moon. "Mensis" is the genitive form of 
"mens", the Latin word for "mind" or "thought". The particular case translates as "of the mind" or "mind's".

H@Constable's Garb is a Chest Armor (Attire) in Bloodborne. It is part of the Constable Set and was added with The Old Hunters DLC.

d^"Once upon a time a troupe of foreign constables chased a beast all the way to Yahrnam, and this is what they wore. 
The constables became victims of the beast, except for one survivor, who in turn devoured the creature whole, all by himself. 
The fable is a favorite among Yahrnamites, who are partial to any stories of pompous, intolerant foreigners, who 
suffer for their ignorance. It makes the blood taste that much sweeter."
