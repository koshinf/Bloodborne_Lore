    <name>Amygdalan Arm</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"The arm of a small Amygdala Great One. 
    Strictly speaking, the Amygdalan Arm is no trick weapon of any sort, but certain madmen wield them like clubs. 
    Starts as a large, tough blunt weapon formed of bone, but when extended, the hand quivers as if it were still alive.
    </description><location place = "The Hunter's Nightmare"> The Hunter's Nightmare, cave at the end of the blood river to the right after getting out of the building that used to be the shortcut to the Cleric Beast in the main game. Gatling Gun Hunter dropping the Gatling Gun and a Blood-Starved Beast can be also found here. Arm is near the Blood-Starved Beast at the end of the cave.
    </location><trivia>
    The Amygdalan Arm is a Trick Weapon in name only, considering that it is an arm obtained from Amygdala.
    The arm is remarkably small, as even the Lesser Amygdalae are huge. Perhaps it came from a newborn Amygdala.
    The arm could be the inspiration behind the Burial Blade.</trivia>
    
    <name>Beast Claw</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"Beastly weapon wielded by Irreverent Izzy.
    Crafted by chiseling the long bones of an undead darkbeast and fastening them to the weapon. The bones are still alive, and when unleashed, grant its wielder a spurt of beastly power. 
    As flesh is flayed and blood is sprayed, the beast within awakens, and in time, the wielder of this weapon surges with both strength and feverish reverie."
    </description><location place = "Ailing Loran Chalice">
    Ailing Loran Chalice: Layer 2 treasure room. Room is on the right when exiting the elevator from first layer boss fight, before the second layers lantern.
    Can be bought from messengers for 34000 echoes after acquisition.
    Can be bought from messengers after co-operation with player who has them. This only occurs in Hunter's dream before fight with Gehrman or Moon Presence. It is not needed to complete any Chalice Dungeons. It is unknown if this is glitch or intentional. Was patched by 1.07 or 1.08.
    </location><trivia>
    When this weapon is equipped, your gloves will be replaced by two bone gauntlets. This can allow for the lost art of rapid glove changing if you switch your weapons really fast.
    You can charge the beasthood meter on the first windows (Gilbert) of Central Yharnam
    In the past, there was a rare glitch that allowed a player to obtain this weapon without finding it in the Chalice Dungeons.
    It has since been patched, although it isn't quite known when it was successfully patched.</trivia>
    
    <name>Beasthunter Saif</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"A trick weapon used by the old hunters. 
    A second blade is found inside the curve of the main one. In its initial form, the saif can be wielded like a long curved sword, but when transformed, its blade is contracted, allowing for quick, repeated stabs. 
    Although this trick weapon allows for adaptive combat, it was later replaced by saws and similar weapons that were more effective at disposing of beasts."
    </description><location place = "The Hunter's Nightmare">
    The Hunter's Nightmare. After the Blood River, when you pass through the cave with a tick, where you encounter two dogs and a large amount of crows along with an enemy Beast Cutter hunter. Climb the ladder on the left of the pit and instead of going forward, turn to the left and drop down the ledge. There will be a single piece of loot guarded by a Saif Hunter.
    </location><trivia>
    The word "saif" is Arabic for "sword."</trivia>
    
    <name>Beast Cutter</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"A trick weapon used by Old Hunters. 
    This thick iron cleaver slices through the toughest of beast hides, and when transformed the blade splits into sections, allowing one to lash it in the fashion of a heavy whip. 
    This crude weapon relies on brute force and is regrettably inelegant, suggesting that the hunts of the earliest hunters made for horrific affairs, painted in sanguine black and reds."
    </description><location place = "Grand Cathedral">When walking up the stairs to the nightmare version of the Grand Cathedral, turn left onto a small platform, then roll off and walk down some rough terrain to find the weapon on a corpse.
    Reminds many of the Zanpakutō , a fictional segmented sword that can function as a whip. It is an iconic weapon from the Bleach anime.
    </location>The untransformed form of the weapon is a cleaver-like serrated club, and it really looks like the samoan war club "Nifo Oti".

    <name>Blade of Mercy</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
   <description> "A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. One of the oldest weapons of the workshop. 
    Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective swift attacks,such as after a quick-stepping."
    </description><location place = "null">Can be purchased from the Messengers for 40000 echoes after obtaining the Crow Hunter Badge from Eileen the Crow's quest line.
    Killing Eileen is also a way to get the weapon early in the game.
    While progressing through Eileen's quest, it's possible for her to be killed by Henryk and thus drop the Crow Hunter Badge as a result, although the quest line will end.
    </location><trivia>The Blade of Mercy was originally named as "Warped Twinblades" during the Alpha test, and it was the tool of choice for the "agile" hunter.
    Both the Burial Blade and Blade of Mercy make mentions of a mineral known as siderite in their descriptions.
    is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite, and it seems to be the reason why arcane power has direct scaling with both blade's damage output. Due to its extraterrestrial origins, that may explain why it cannot be buffed by an external source of any sort.
    It loosely resembles the Eleum Loyce from Dark Souls 2, a sword with two blades at the front.</trivia>
    
    <name>Bloodletter</name> (Japanese: 瀉血の槌 Phlebotomy Hammer) is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"The demented hunter weapon brandished by Brador, the Healing Church assassin. 
    The Bloodletter assumes its true and terrifying form after it draws upon blood from the inner reaches of one's body and soul. 
    This is the only effective means of expelling tainted blood, or so Brador, isolated in his cell, continued to believe."
    </description><location place = "Underground Prison">Obtain the underground cell inner chamber key.
    Return to the underground prison (from the underground corpse pile lamp, go up the stairs and turn left) and open the door to Brador's cell. His cell is the second on the left behind a flight of downward stairs. Kill Brador to obtain the bloodletter.
    Brador will not be hostile in his cell, but will invade the player right outside his cell.
    </location><trivia>[Bloodletting/Phlebotomy is the practice of drawing blood from patients for testing, to cure or prevent illness and disease.]</trivia>

    <name>Boom Hammer</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"A trick weapon used by the old hunters, and crafted by the workshop heretics, the Powder Kegs. 
    A giant hammer equipped with a miniature furnace. When ignited and fired, it emits a volley of flame that explodes furiously upon impact. 
    Crush the beasts, then burn them - the brute simplicity of the Boom Hammer was favored by hunters with an acute distaste for beasts."
    </description><location place = "The Hunter's Nightmare">The Hunter's Nightmare. Inside a house that looks out of Central Yharnam, the same that is the shortcut to the cleric beast in the main game, where the 10 quicksilver bullets used to be. Be sure to shoot the explosives around the item (or act fast), as the wheelchair huntsman's corpse conceals a delayed molotov set to trigger when you try to grab the Boom Hammer, potential killing you in a huge blast.
    </location><trivia>When the Boomhammer is lit, Beast Patient mobs will back away from the player as if they had a torch equipped. (May need to initiate primed attack first)</trivia>

    <name>Burial Blade</name> (Japanese: 葬送の刃 Funeral Blade) is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"Trick weapon wielded by Gehrman, the first hunter." 
    A masterpiece that defined the entire array of weapons crafted at the workshop. Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens. 
    Gehrman surely saw the hunt as a dirge of farewell, wishing only that his prey might rest in peace, never again to awaken to another harrowing nightmare. "
    </description><location place = "null">It can be purchased from the Messengers for 60,000 Blood Echoes after defeating Gehrman, the First Hunter and acquiring the Old Hunter Badge from him.
    To make Gehrman fight you, the "Refuse" option must be selected.
    If one accepts his proposal, the game will outright end there and it will be impossible to obtain this weapon in that playthrough (not including the uncanny/lost forms found in the chalice dungeons).
    Normally, the Burial Blade can only be obtained in NG+ and beyond. However, one can bypass this by using Bold Hunter's Mark, or being killed, during The Moon Presence boss battle.
    </location>The Burial Blade was the first trick weapon ever created, and it inspired others to develop new trick weapons, usually on the premise of adapting to different combat scenerios.
    <trivia>Not all weapons adapt to different combat scenerios (e.g. Tonitrus), but the Burial Blade still inspired an entire series of weapons that could "transform" to satisfy different purposes.
    It was created, and exclusively wielded, by Gehrman.
    A Burial Blade can be found above the workshop table in the Hunter's Dream.
    The weapon's description mentions that "Its blade is forged with siderite, said to have fallen from the heavens."
    is the real-life alternate name for an iron meteorite. Due to its extraterrestrial nature, it could be the reason why it has direct scaling with arcane and cannot be tampered by external sources.
    Both the Burial Blade and the Blade of Mercy mentions the use of it in their descriptions.
    Interestingly enough, these two weapons also resemble the talons of Mergo's Wet Nurse.
    The shape of the scythe highly resembles Rurufon's scythe from Shadow Tower Abyss, an early title created by From Software as well as being recurring weapons in Souls series.
    A strange bug on rare occurrences the cape on the hunter may come off, usually in a boss fight you could notice if you dodge back and do an R1 combo the cape disappears. [Note, I haven't seen this happen in a while, it's possible that it may have been fixed, but I'll need confirmation on this]</trivia>

    <name>Chikage</name> (千景 Chikage lit. "A Thousand Views") is a <type>katana</type>.
    <description>"Foreign-made weapon wielded by the royal guards who protect Annalise, Queen of the Vilebloods at Cainhurst Castle. 
    When the intricate, rippled engraving that spans the Chikage's blade is imbrued with blood, the sword sings in scarlet hues. 
    However, the rite eats away at the wielder's very essence."
    </description><location place = "Cainhurst Castle">Join the Cainhurst Vilebloods covenant available at Cainhurst Castle, and then purchase from the Messengers for 50,000 Blood Echoes.
    </location><trivia>The Chikage isn't actually a katana - it is a katana/european sword hybrid. Its short crossguard resembles the one of an early viking sword, or the one of a xiphos (greek sword). The closest european crossguard shape with  this sword is the one of a Karabela (a polish sabre). In other hand, the  hilt and pommel resemble the ones of a longsword (a bit longer, to get easier katana traditional jutsu swings), while the blade shape and the 2-handed fighting style is very similar to a katana. A possible explanation for the origin of this hybrid is that the katana's design was imported to Cainhurst, where some modifications were made to create a sword similar to that commonly used by their knights.
    The Chikage is an allusion to a particular 'breed' of Katanas in the Souls games. While it is similar to both the Hiltless and Chaos Blade from Demon's Souls and Dark Souls respectively, the Chikage bears a stronger resemblance to the Magic Sword "Makoto" (also from Demon's Souls). The Makoto is the only one the bunch to actually DRAIN the user's HP over time, rather than decrease it with each successful swing.
    Chikage (千景) literally means "Thousands Views", however if you separated the word into Chi Kage (血影), it means "Blood Shadow". This could be correlated to the fact that Shadows Of Yharnam wield a similar katana with a slight  crossguard, however without using the bloodtinge.
    The transforming attack has the hunter sheathe the Chikage before unleashing a strike. This is a reference to Iaijutsu, a traditional Japanese sword technique that focuses on quick-drawing. At its finest, Iaijutse allows the warrior to unsheathe and strike at incredible speeds.
    The name seems to be a tribute to Chikage Yamamura (mentioned as a "special thanks" in credits)
    The name may also be a reference to the work "1000 Plateaus" by Giles Deluze and Felix Guattari, a famous philosophical essay about fluidity and functionality, maybe dirrectly tied to the esoteric nature of the weapons function.</trivia>

    <name>Church Pick</name> is a <trivia>trick weapon</trivia>
    <description>"One of the old trick weapons of the Healing Church, a hunting weapon formed from one of the giant picks that appear in old beast tales. 
    The Church Pick initially serves as a large sword, but when transformed functions as an extended war pick. In spite of its origins, it is a highly practical weapon."
    </description><location place = "Hunter's Nightmare">The Hunter's Nightmare: Dropped by a hunter wearing Yahar'Gul set (presumably, this is the summonable Old Hunter Defector Antal) in one of the cells that you open with the Underground Cell Key from the Research Hall. To make this battle simple, attack him through the door with a strong R2 attack, then leave the room. He will lose sight of you and his AI will return to a standstill behind the door. Rinse and repeat until dead.
    </location><trivia>The Church Pick And The Hunter's Axe both have similar appearance. When transformed, both are wielded as a polearm and have the same de-transformation attack. The only difference apart from the Church Pick having a slightly more complicated mechanism is that the Hunter's Axe is a strength-based weapon.
    A few of its attacks in the transformed mode are very similar to that of the Burial Blade.
    The Church Pick os the weapon of choice of the summonable Old Hunter NPC Defector Antal</trivia>

    <name>Holy Moonlight Sword</name> is a <type>Trick Weapon</type>
    <description>"An arcane sword discovered long ago by Ludwig. 
    When blue moonlight dances around the sword, and it channels the abyssal cosmos, its great blade will hurl a shadowy lightwave. 
    The Holy Moonlight Sword is synonymous with Ludwig, the Holy Blade, but few have ever set eyes on the great blade, and whatever guidance it has to offer, it seems to be of a very private, elusive sort."
    </description><location place = "The Hunter's Nightmare">The Hunter's Nightmare: Found on the Underground Corpse Pile after the fight against Ludwig, The Holy Blade. Ludwig's head will be lying there and you can:
    Kill the head for the sword.
    Wear a piece of any church attire and talk to the head. When prompted, reply "Yes" and you'll get the sword.
    Wear a piece of any church attire and reply "No", then come back later and Simon the Harrowed will be there and give you the sword.
    NOTE: This weapon is missable. If Lawrence is killed before you obtain it, you will no longer be able to talk to the head or obtain it from Simon.
    </location><trivia>seems to be another reappearance of the Moonlight Greatsword, a recurring item found around FromSoftware's games. Notable examples of such games include the first, second and third Dark Souls games, Demon's Souls, King's Field, Ninja Blade, Enchanted Arms, Armored Core, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Otogi.
    Lore theories exist under "Ebrietas Lore (Seath the Scaleless)".</trivia>
