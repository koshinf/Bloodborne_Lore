        <description>Hunter attire of Gehrman, the first hunter. Created before the workshop existed
            by making adjustments to everyday clothing, and later became the basis for all hunter's
            garb. The hunter's emphasis on engaging beasts with speed, and therefore of selecting
            lightweight attire, no doubt traces back to Gehrman's own combat style." </description>

        <description>Most tomb prospectors, members of the Healing Church chosen to explore the old
            labyrinth, are unable to withstand the weight of the old knowledge, and go mad. This
            attire is worn by those lost souls. Truth oft resembles madness, inaccessible to the
            dull of mind. Those who go mad are merely thoughtful souls who failed to reach any
            conclusions."</description>

        <description>Once upon a time a troupe of foreign constables chased a beast all the way to
            Yahrnam, and this is what they wore. The constables became victims of the beast, except
            for one survivor, who in turn devoured the creature whole, all by himself. The fable is
            a favorite among Yahrnamites, who are partial to any stories of pompous, intolerant
            foreigners, who suffer for their ignorance. It makes the blood taste that much
