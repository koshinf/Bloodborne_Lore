				<p>The main goal of the "Bloodborne Lore" project is to look through the following
				vast amounts of data that are in the game and determine which hold the most significant value
				in relation to all other data:

				<ul>
					<li>Item descriptions</li>
					<li>Npc dialogue</li>
					<li>Boss descriptions</li>
					<li>Weapon descriptions</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Bloodborne is an Action Role Playing Game that has you, the player, fight through hordes of 
				terrifying enemies in order to progress in the game.  Unlike in most games, there isn't a character
				that tells you exactly where you are supposed to be going, instead you are left to explore the 
				environment to figure out your next path.  This can lead to unexepcted boss fights which serve to 
				make the game more exciting.</p>
				
				<p>Having a project such as this based around this game in particular is necessary mainly because 
				we believe that Bloodborne is a very unique experience compared to other options in the medium.  
				However, there are similar games to it in the form of its predecessors, Demon's Souls and Dark Souls,  
				that serve as a blueprint for what Bloodborne eventually turned into.</p>
				
				<p>We hope to find correlations between all the data we have gathered in order to find
				which data points hold the most significance in relation to the other data points, and perhaps even 
				discover a general theme just through what is most referenced without knowing anything about the game.  
				As an added bonus to knowing all these data points, we can also visually show the locations on a map.</p>
