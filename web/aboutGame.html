				<h1>About Bloodborne</h1>
				
				<h2>General Info</h2>
				<p>Bloodborne is an ARPG(Action Role Playing Game) developed by FROM SOFTWARE for PlayStation 4.  
				You spend the time in the game as a "Hunter" while exploring the Victorian-inspired Yharnam, 
				a city plagued by bloodborne disease that has turned a majority of the citizens into beasts.  
			    The game itself takes partial inspiration from H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker, as well as
				taking some building designs from real life locations in Romania and the Czech Republic.
				</p>
				<p>Bloodborne received critical acclaim, with praise being directed at its gameplay, particularly its high
				level of difficulty, sound design, atmospheric environments, interconnected world design, and plot, and is
				often regarded as an important example of video games as art. However, some criticism was directed at its 
				technical performance at launch, which was improved with post-release updates. An expansion for the game, 
				titled The Old Hunters, was released in November 2015. By the end of 2015, the game had sold over two 
				million copies worldwide. Bloodborne was nominated for many awards and accolades, and has been cited as 
				one of the greatest video games of all time. Bloodborne also had a few spinoffs related to it produced, 
				such as a card game and a comic book series.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Synopsis</h2>
				<p>Bloodborne takes place in Yharnam, a decrepit Gothic city known for its medical advances using blood as 
				a primary tool. Over the years, many travelers journey to the city seeking the remedy to cure their
				afflictions; the player's character journeys to Yharnam seeking something known as Paleblood for reasons 
				unknown. Upon arriving in the city, however, it is discovered that Yharnam is plagued with an endemic 
				illness that has transformed most of its citizens into bestial creatures. The player must navigate the 
				streets of Yharnam during the night of The Hunt, and overcome its violently deranged inhabitants and 
				horrifying monsters in order to stop the source of the plague and escape the nightmare.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Plot</h2>
				<p>The game's first few moments are seen in a first-person view through the eyes of a Hunter; who sees that
				they are being operated on by an old man. The man explains that he is performing a blood transfusion, and
				tells the Hunter they've "come to the right place" in seeking Paleblood. He warns the Hunter that they
				will go on a strange journey that will seem like a bad dream. The Hunter then passes out after seeing 
				several beastly creatures approach them. After the player has created their Hunter, the game is seen in the
				standard third-person view, and the Hunter awakes on an operating table in a small clinic. Upon exiting the
				room, the Hunter discovers they're in Yharnam, full of dangerous monsters and mysteries, and begins their 
				journey.
				</p>
				<p>Shortly after their arrival in Yharnam, the player enters a spectral realm called the Hunter's Dream, 
				which acts as both a sanctuary and workshop. The player encounters two entities: Gehrman, an elderly,
				wheelchair-bound man who provides advice to Hunters like the player; and the Doll, a living life-size doll 
				that assists the player in leveling up and emotionally bonds with the Hunter over the course of the game. 
				Gehrman informs the player that in order to obtain the blood they seek and escape the dream, they must hunt 
				down the various monsters plaguing Yharnam, and halt the source of the plague. As the Hunter delves deeper 
				into the city, they begin to learn its dark secrets, as well as the origin of the plague that's destroying 
				it. Long ago, the residents of Yharnam began worshiping ancient, eldritch cosmic beings known as the Great 
				Ones after scholars from the College of Byrgenwerth discovered something referred to as a "medium" in the
				ruins of an ancient, highly advanced civilization that Yharnam was built on top of. The Great Ones provided
				the healing blood Yharnam was famous for, which is also the source of the plague.

				<h2>Combat</h2>
				<p>Combat in Bloodborne is extremely fast-paced compared to previous entries, and has you attacking way more often 
				rather than defending.  There are points where you can get overrun by enemies if you choose to play defensively rather
				than attack and it can get crowded.  You basically want to kill your enemey before they land a hit on you.  If they do
				manage to land a hit, the game comes with a new system called Rally.  Rally allows your character to keep attacking even 
				while taking damage by returning a portion of your lost health to you on successful hits.  In lore reasons for this is 
				that the blood from your enemies fuels the beast blood in your character essentially making your character too angry to 
				die if I may slide that meme in there.  There is a New-Game Plus mode as is tradition in soulsborne games which allows 
				you to restart the main game with your current equipment and level, at the cost of making the game harder(aka give 
				enemies more health and damage).
				</p>
				<p>The player may only wield two melee weapons and two secondary weapons at one time. Most melee weapons,
				called Trick Weapons, can transform into an alternate state; each state encourages a different approach 
				to combat. For example, the Hunter Axe in its initial state is wielded with one hand and can be used to
				quickly dispatch enemies in cramped areas, but when transformed into its secondary state, it becomes an
				extended two handed weapon more suited for crowd control. With most Trick Weapons, one state is usually
				a slower, bigger weapon, that deals heavier damage per hit, while the other state is smaller, faster, and 
				deals its damage in hit streaks. The player's main secondary weapon is a firearm; the firearm,
				usually a pistol, can be used in a traditional sense, as well as a way to stun enemies. When an enemy is
				stunned, the player can perform a Visceral attack; Visceral attacks cause a large amount of damage in one 
				hit and can also be performed after the player strikes an enemy from behind with a charged attack. Other 
				secondary weapons include a torch, cannon, and wooden shield, while other main melee weapons include a 
				hammer, sword, two-handed gun, which serves as the melee and ranged weapon, and a whip. The player can 
				carry other offensive weapons, such as molotovs, throwing knives, and pebbles.
